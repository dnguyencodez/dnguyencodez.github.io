## EvadeDroid: A Practical Evasion Attack on Machine Learning for Black-box Android Malware Detection (Seminar 8.1)



### Discussion Summary

---
- Mention main idea of using opaque predicates, dead code, etc.
- The reason that droppers aren't used is that Android doesn't support them and that once a dropper is used, the program file is immediately reordered, and thus the dropper is not needed
  - The implementation is the same without being the same, Android uses different abstraction layers than x86, for example
  - Compiled languages have assembly instructions (C for example), but Android is built on Java which is easier to handle as there is more high level information
  - Compiled vs interpreted languages have different security implications
- The attack used in this paper is 'semi black box' as the authors know that the target model is based on code along with other information
- In theory, EvadeDroid can be used for Windows PE files
  - Implementation will be different, but the concepts will be similar such as using opaque predicates, dead code, etc.
  - The first android attacks were based on manifest files which list permissions and more
  - Attacks against manifest files (where there are boolean vectors of manifest permissions) are also possible through
- Gadgets are essential in security as they fall under return oriented programming attacks which can be used to control the stack pointers as a result of buffer overflow, leading to control of the program
- Markov decision processes (which are a chain of state action pairs while accounting for the probability of choosing the best next state, using previous state information) can also be applied to malware detection
  - Function calls, for instance, can be represented as a markov decision process by determining the probability of a function being chosen or called next.
