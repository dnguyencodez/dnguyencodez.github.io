## Machine Learning for Malware Detection (Seminar 1.1)

During this seminar, student Eric Muller presented a summary of [Machine Learning for Malware Detection](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf). After Eric's presentation our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information discussed by Eric as well as a summary of our class discussion.

### Presentation Summary

As this was the first seminar, it covers a high level overview of the machine learning space in relation to malware detection. Below are the main ideas presented by Eric.

- Malware detection collects data at different phases
- Pre-execution phase data consists of file information prior to execution (file format descriptions, code descriptions, binary data statistics, etc.)
- Post-execution data communicates process activity within a system
- The advancement of malware raises the need of Machine Learning which can be broken down into unsupervised and supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning consists of unlabeled datasets (an example algorithm is clustering) whereas supervised learning consists of labeled data with a training phase and application phase
- Regarding ML in cybersecurity, you generally want your datasets to be representative (mirrors real life data) and interpretable (helps you understand the decisions made)
- Minimizing the false positive rate is the main metric objective
- It is important to create adaptable models that update as data distributions change
- Malware writers rapidly advanced from their early days with new techniques like server-side polymorphism and file editing to change fingerprints
