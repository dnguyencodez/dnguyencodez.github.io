### Discussion Summary

---
- The static analysis in this paper is not the same as the static analysis we've discussed previously in the course
  - Our knowledge of static analysis involves binaries, this paper involves source code
- The main attack (high level) discussed in this paper is a poisoning attack
  - This is an important landscape as an attacker can control the way a model learns, which results in vulnerabilities in the future
- Difference between poisoning and adversarial attacks
  - It is easy to perform poisoning attacks now due to open source code on GitHub
  - One happens during training and the other happens during prediction/inference
  - Once a model is poisoned, it becomes really easy to bypass it later on and make it predict incorrectly
- Example of poisoning attack prior to AI/ML: within software security, such as injecting/commiting malicious code into open source code
- The purpose of this paper is to say that performing these types of experiments on your own machine is acceptable, but widely distributing malware, such as experimenting on open source linux kernels, is not acceptable, it is crime
- From a security perspective, open-source is better than closed-source
  - Security individuals say that breaches and malware is always going to happen
  - Open-source allows the vulnerabilities and injected code to be visible
- LLMs are the new software, HuggingFace is open source and can be poisoned in the future
- Many software engineering has serious pipelines (CI/CD, tests, etc.) that perform static analysis with defined rules to reject malicious/unsafe code
  - The authors, thus, propose that LLMs should be experimented with these poisoning attacks as no one is checking their pipelines
- LLMs predict/suggest based off probabilities, so the way attackers must inject their code a lot in order for the LLM to learn and suggest it
  - In covert attacks, comments are analagous to dead code (mean nothing to LLMs and compilers)
  - This can be poisoned by attackers by injecting comments suggesting malicious code content into github repositories, rather than directly inserting into the target LLM
- Attackers make fake accounts to inject code into public repositories
  - There is a majority vote algorithm that makes a network system the leader of that party of systems
  - An attacker can produce many fake accounts to win the majority vote and become the leader, similar to the approach proposed in this paper
  - Federated learning is another attack that is common in networking
  - Essentially, if you think like an attacker and know the attacks, you can apply the same concepts to ML and ML based malware detectors
- In this domain or CS in general, there is always a tradeoff between performance and storage
