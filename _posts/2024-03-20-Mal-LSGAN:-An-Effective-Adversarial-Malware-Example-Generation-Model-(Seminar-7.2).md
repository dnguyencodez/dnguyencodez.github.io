## Mal-LSGAN: An Effective Adversarial Malware Example Generation Model (Seminar 7.2)

**NOTE**: This blog is for a special topics course at Texas A&M (ML for Cyber Defenses). During each lecture a student presents information from the assigned paper. This blog summarizes and further discusses each topic.

During this seminar, Vishal Adepu, Rohith Yogi, and Bhavan Dondapati presented [Mal-LSGAN: An Effective Adversarial Malware Example Generation Model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3375894.3375898?casa_token=2AMOrMymeNUAAAAA:2_gmqLQwhwg_4iQfLEb6tXOgEc14XcyuFh0T1xm7CnwrMcDGyrUEWifi5EIZEAMCrIRi3qizZjU](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3433667.3433669?casa_token=eEW4bOQHFG4AAAAA:NDdeq08vALIlAjKaK2HODkj5oRBRr1v-5K43jqaSEI5vBmpaINY20wonwAAThCytkMht5oE21tM)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9437194)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9685442)). After their presentation our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information presented as well as a summary of our class discussion.

### Discussion Summary

----
- Key message for any paper is to not completely trust their results. The authors did run their own experiments, but you should also run your own experiments to find out
- Main idea of Mal-LSGAN is to create two neural networks that fight each other (since we automate malware generation and detection)
  - Use the feedback of one model (either the generator or discriminator) to update the other
  - When the two models reach equilibrium, since there is a feedback loop, then the process stops. In the end you have the best attacker on one side and best defender on another side
- Why do we need a discriminator, why not just attack the target directly?
  - In reality, sometimes we do not need a discriminator, we can just attack the black box detector
  - However, the detector being blackbox is one reason why it sometimes can't work as there could be rate limiting and more
  - That's why we need our own local model, the discriminator
  - Bypassing the GAN is the same as bypassing the detector when they are closely similar. Changing the architecture of the GAN will not transfer the same results
- Why don't we get a pre-trained discriminator?
  - We want the ideal discriminator, a pre-trained one will not be ideal
- Using a pool of models is a plausible defense against adversarial examples
- The generator can cause concept drift, so over time the discriminator needs to be updated
- These types of generated adversarial attacks most commonly reflect state and nations attacks
- Skilled attackers sell their tools and botnets to others
  - There is also Malware as a Service (MaaS), and can be sold inside a packer/dropper and etc.
  - Even though this is not practical right now, the concept of GANs can become sold and widespread in the future
- GANs come from image generation
  - "This person does not exist" website for example. Generative AI (stable diffusion) can be applied to various domains: images, malware, etc.
