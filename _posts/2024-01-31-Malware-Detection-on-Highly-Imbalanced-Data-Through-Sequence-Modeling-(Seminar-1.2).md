## Malware Detection on Highly Imbalanced Data through Sequence Modeling (Seminar 1.2)

**NOTE**: This blog is for a special topics course at Texas A&M (ML for Cyber Defenses). During each lecture a student presents information from the assigned paper. This blog summarizes and further discusses each topic.

During this seminar, students Akshat Punjabi and Akshat Pandey presented information from [Malware Detection on Highly Imbalanced Data through Sequence Modeling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3338501.3357374). After their presentation our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information discussed by both Akshats as well as a summary of our class discussion.

### Presentation Summary
This seminar covers dynamic analysis on sequences of Android OS malware detection activity. Below are the main ideas presented:

#### Static vs Dynamic Analysis
- Static analysis consists of analyzing an application without it being executed (program structure and used utilities)
- Dynamic analysis consists of analyzing an application in a sandbox based on actual API calls and execution
- This paper covers malware detection using dynamic analysis

#### Traditional Malware Detection Technique: Rule-based approach
- Uses explicit rules to classify software as benign or malicious
- Recognizes threats through known signatures and patterns
- Problems:
  - Tends to have a high FPR due to inconsistenices in system behavior
  - Hard to generate heuristics (best guesses or estimations) without ample domain knowledge
  - Easy for adversarial machine learning (attacker can disguise malware as benign within a sequence of actions)
