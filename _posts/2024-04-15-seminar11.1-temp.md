### Discussion Summary

---
- Why not use a multi-class classifier for everyone?
  - Employees come and go, companies don't want to retrain everytime an employee leaves/new one arrives
  - Also, the problem boils down to a one-class classification problem (not multi-class or even binary)
    - Model is only determining if the person is actually the user (not what 'class' of user)
    - Binary classification also learns what is not the user, which is not needed
