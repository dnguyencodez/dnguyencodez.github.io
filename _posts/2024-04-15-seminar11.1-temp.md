### Discussion Summary

---
- Why not use a multi-class classifier for everyone?
  - Employees come and go, companies don't want to retrain everytime an employee leaves/new one arrives
  - Also, the problem boils down to a one-class classification problem (not multi-class or even binary)
    - Model is only determining if the person is actually the user (not what 'class' of user)
    - Binary classification also learns what is not the user, which is not needed
- Web domain data is a heavily weighted feature in this study, does it help the threat model?
  - Doesn't help for corporations since they have a lot of internal tools/websites and have restricted access to external domains
  - It is hard to ask companies to do a research study on their internal systems
- This approach is more robust than purely using bio-informatics
  - Constantly asking for a password is not ideal
  - Attackers can gain access to internal system data including bio-informatics
  - This study proposes a more usable security solution and is more robust utilizing user web and habits data
