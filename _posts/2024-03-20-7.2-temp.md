### Discussion Summary

----
- Key message for any paper is to not completely trust their results. The authors did run their own experiments, but you should also run your own experiments to find out
- Main idea of Mal-LSGAN is to create two neural networks that fight each other (since we automate malware generation and detection)
  - Use the feedback of one model (either the generator or discriminator) to update the other
  - When the two models reach equilibrium, since there is a feedback loop, then the process stops. In the end you have the best attacker on one side and best defender on another side
- Why do we need a discriminator, why not just attack the target directly?
  - In reality, sometimes we do not need a discriminator, we can just attack the black box detector
  - However, the detector being blackbox is one reason why it sometimes can't work as there could be rate limiting and more
  - That's why we need our own local model, the discriminator
  - Bypassing the GAN is the same as bypassing the detector when they are closely similar. Changing the architecture of the GAN will not transfer the same results
- Why don't we get a pre-trained discriminator?
  - We want the ideal discriminator, a pre-trained one will not be ideal
- Using a pool of models is a plausible defense against adversarial examples
