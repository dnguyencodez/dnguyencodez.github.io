## Automatic Yara Rule Generation Using Biclustering (Seminar 12.1)


### Discussion Summary

---
- These authors are proposing an approach that utilizes machine learning and rules which make it more readable
- They are using biclustering to cluster in two dimensions instead of one (two constraints)
  - Ex: try to maximize the coverage in one direction and minimze the coverage in the other which combats issue with single clustering
- AVs use both ML and signatures
  - Many people make bold statements that AVs use only one, but they are wrong
  - Sometimes ML works better for some cases whereas signatures work better with others
  - Concept drift is a good example of use case
    - When a new malware sample is encountered, it takes a lot of effort and time to retrain
    - Thus, in the meantime, create and extract the signature
  - Signatures and using Yara rules are much faster than ML models since Yara rules are byte based
- Another pitfall is that if an AV uses a rule then no ML is used
  - The rules can be generated by an ML model
- Storing the rules is complicated so what is an efficient way to store the rules?
  - Bloom filter: probablistic data structure that reduces the storage size, however a tradeoff is that it increases false positives
    - Data is passed through hash function and then stored as an index in the array
    - A specific byte will always be mapped to an index/value
    - Drawback is that bloom filters use a hash function which means potential for collisions, and hence some bytes will be mapped to different and irrelevant indicies/values
    - The drawback only increases FPs, not FNs
  - Bloom filters are typically a good solution and should be used more
