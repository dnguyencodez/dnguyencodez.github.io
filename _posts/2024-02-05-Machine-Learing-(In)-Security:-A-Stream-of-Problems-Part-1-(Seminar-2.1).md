## Machine Learning (In) Security: A Stream of Problems Part 1 (Seminar 2.1)

**NOTE**: This blog is for a special topics course at Texas A&M (ML for Cyber Defenses). During each lecture a student presents information from the assigned paper. This blog summarizes and further discusses each topic.

This seminar was presented by me! I covered sections 3, 4, and 5 of [Machine Learning (In) Security: A Stream of Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16045) which provides an overview of the various pitfalls in standard machine learning process when applied to cybersecurity and how to overcome them. After the presentation, our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information presented as well as a summary of our class discussion.
