## Machine Learning (In) Security: A Stream of Problems Part 1 (Seminar 2.1)

**NOTE**: This blog is for a special topics course at Texas A&M (ML for Cyber Defenses). During each lecture a student presents information from the assigned paper. This blog summarizes and further discusses each topic.

This seminar was presented by me! I covered sections 3, 4, and 5 of [Machine Learning (In) Security: A Stream of Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16045). After the presentation, our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information presented as well as a summary of our class discussion.
