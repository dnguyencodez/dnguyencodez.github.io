## Shallow Security: on the Creation of Adversarial Variants to Evade Machine Learning-Based Malware Detectors (Seminar 6.1)

**NOTE**: This blog is for a special topics course at Texas A&M (ML for Cyber Defenses). During each lecture a student presents information from the assigned paper. This blog summarizes and further discusses each topic.

During this seminar, Johnny Le presented [Shallow Security: on the Creation of Adversarial Variants to Evade Machine Learning-Based Malware Detectors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3375894.3375898?casa_token=2AMOrMymeNUAAAAA:2_gmqLQwhwg_4iQfLEb6tXOgEc14XcyuFh0T1xm7CnwrMcDGyrUEWifi5EIZEAMCrIRi3qizZjU). After his presentation our class had an open discussion related to the paper and more. This blog post will cover a summary of the information presented as well as a summary of our class discussion.

### Presentation Summary

#### Introduction
- ML-based approaches are currently state-of-the-art techniques for malware detection
- They are not completely perfect, stimulating the existing arms race with attackers generating malware to exploit problems in ML-based approaches, and defenders creating new models
